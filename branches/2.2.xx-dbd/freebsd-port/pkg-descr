mod_myvhost is Apache module for dynamically configured name based mass virtual
hosting with PHP, virtual host's configurations and PHP settings are stored in
database.

No need to have every vhost in apache's configuration file, no need to restart
apache after configuration changed (vhost added|deleted, vhost rootdir changed,
vhost unblocked/unblocked...).

After all, it is capable to change settings of PHP4/5 dynamically (if php is
loadable module or it is linked with apache) for any vhost. By default, it sets
open_basedir as vhost's rootdir to prevent user from stoling files from other
users and from your server, but you have ability to change almost any parameter
that exists in php.ini, for example, you can turn on safe_mode or
register_globals for particular vhost, if it has old php scripts that use global
variables.
