First of all, this module is based on [http://code.google.com/p/dbd-modules mod_vhost_dbd].

==Building mod_myvhost from ports tree==
Since mod_myvhost now resides in the ports tree, the latest version of *mod_myvhost* is /usr/ports/www/mod_myvhost

===Prerequisities:===
The fist of all you have to rebuild apr, apr-util and apache22 to support _DBD_ and one or some SQL drivers,
because this options are not enabled by default.
I usually check options _DBD_ and _MySQL_ while `make config` for apache22.
So:
{{{
# You have to have root privileges to do this
cd /usr/ports/www/apache22
make deinstall
cd /usr/ports/devel/apr1
make deinstall
cd /usr/ports/www/apache22
make config # check _DBD_ and _SQL-driver_
make all install clean # building and installing apache22 and all required libs
}}}

===Building and installing mod_myvhost===
{{{
# You have to have root privileges to do this
cd /usr/ports/www/mod_myvhost
make config # There are some settings available at compile time: WITH_PHP and DEBUG that are self-explanatory.
make all install clean # building and installing
}}}

==Database:==
Now it is time to create database that will be used to store vhost's configurations.
You can use _/usr/local/share/examples/mod_myvhost/vhosts.sql_ file as example for *MySQL*:
{{{
CREATE DATABASE `hosting`;
USE `hosting`;

CREATE TABLE `vhosts` (
    `vhost` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
#   `valias` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
    `enabled` enum('yes','no') NOT NULL default 'no',
    `rootdir` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
    `admin` varchar(255) default '',
    `extra_php_config` text,
    UNIQUE KEY `vhostname` (`vhost`),
    KEY `enabled` (`enabled`)
) TYPE=MyISAM COMMENT='vhosts';

GRANT SELECT ON hosting.vhosts TO 'nonpriv'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'MeGaPassvv0d';

INSERT INTO `vhosts` VALUES ('w_3.vhost.net', 'yes', '/var/www/vhosts/01', 'w_3@vhost.net', 'safe_mode=off;register_globals=On;open_basedir=/var/www/vhosts/01:/var/www/vhosts/share/pear;');
INSERT INTO `vhosts` VALUES ('www.vhost.net', 'yes', '/var/www/vhosts/02', 'www@vhost.net', '');
}}}

Create database and table:
{{{
mysql -u root -p < vhosts.sql
}}}

==Apache:==
Now we have to edit apache's configuration file, you may use _/usr/local/share/examples/mod_myvhost/httpd.conf.add_ as example:

{{{
<IfModule mod_myvhost.c>
DBDPersist On
DBDriver mysql
DBDParams "host=localhost dbname=hosting user=nonpriv pass=MeGaPassvv0d"
DBDocRoot "SELECT `rootdir` AS DocumentRoot,`admin` AS ServerAdmin,`extra_php_config` AS php_admin FROM `vhosts` WHERE (`vhost` LIKE %s OR CONCAT_WS('.', 'www', `vhost`) LIKE %s) AND `enabled`='yes' LIMIT 1" HOSTNAME HOSTNAME

<Directory "/var/www/vhosts">
RewriteEngine on
Options Indexes SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
AllowOverride FileInfo
Order allow,deny
Allow from all
</Directory>

</IfModule>
}}}


 * You must have Apache [http://people.apache.org/~niq/dbd.html DBD driver] and [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.3/mod/mod_dbd.html mod_dbd] loaded and configured.
 * To be able to change php settins mod_myvhost.so _MUST_ be loaded after libphp5.so.

====DBDocRoot    SQL    [ PARAM ... ]====
*SQL* is an SQL statement.
*PARAM ...* arguments are inserted into the SQL statement at request time.  Use one *PARAM* for each parameter marker in your SQL statement.  In the examples, *%s* is the parameter marker.  *PARAM* may be any of these words (space separated, not case sensitive):
|| *HOSTNAME*||requested hostname|| _may be NULL if there is no Host header. e.g. HTTP 1.0 or FTP requests_ ||
|| *IP*||server IP address|| _as a string, never NULL_ ||
|| *PORT*||server port number|| _as string, never NULL_ ||
|| *URI*||The request URI|| _never NULL_ ||
|| *URI`n`* _where_ *`n`* _is 1-9_ ||Pass only the first `n` segments of the URI to the query|| _never NULL_ ||

 * SQL request MUST return column that is called *DocumentRoot* and optional *ServerAdmin* and *php_admin* columns.
 * For Apache 2.2.9+, any additional columns which are returned will set an [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.3/env.html environment variable] with the same name as the column name. If the column value is NULL, any existing [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.3/env.html environment variable] which matches the column name will be unset.
 * If no vhost have found in DB, than request is served as usual, i.e. you can use vhosts that are defined in _httpd.conf_.
 * *DocumentRoot* is checked to be an real direcory, and *mod_myvhost* sets php's *open_basedir* to *DocumentRoot* and turn on *safe_mode*.
 * If exists directory DocumentRoot/.tmp than php's *upload_tmp_dir* sets to it.
 * If *php_admin* column is returned by SQL request, module parses it and sets php. *php_admin* string should contains pairs of php variables and their values delimited by equality sign, pairs in turn are separated by semicolon, for boolean variables you should use 1 and 0. There are should be no spaces. 
 * Some databases (for example: Firebird) may report errors when statements for *DBDocRoot* are prepared with [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.3/mod/mod_dbd.html#dbdpreparesql DBDPrepareSQL]. In this case, [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.3/mod/mod_dbd.html#dbdpreparesql DBDPrepareSQL] cannot be used for virtual host statements.
 * For Apache 2.2 prior to version 2.2.9, use parameter markers appropriate to your database.  For example: Use *?* for [http://odbc-dbd.googlecode.com/ ODBC] or SQLite.  Use *%s* for MySQL, etc.
 * For Apache 2.2.9+ always use *%s* as a parameter marker in your SQL statement.  If your SQL statement contains other *%* characters (for example, in a LIKE clause), use *%%* to prevent them from being misinterpreted as parameter markers.
 * Using a URI *PARAM* increases the number of database queries required because each request requires a new query. Using only the leading portion of the URI can reduce the number of database queries required. When multiple requests are made on the same keep-alive connection which have the same URI`n` value, only one query is performed.
 * If the URI is /alpha/beta/gamma/delta/index.html:
{{{
URI1 is /alpha
URI2 is /alpha/beta
URI3 is /alpha/beta/gamma
...
URI5 is /alpha/beta/gamma/delta/index.html
URI6 is /alpha/beta/gamma/delta/index.html
...
URI9 is /alpha/beta/gamma/delta/index.html
URI  is /alpha/beta/gamma/delta/index.html
}}}
 * If [http://httpd.apache.org/modules/ mod_ftp] is used, an additional *PARAM* name is available. *FTPUSER* can be specified to pass the logged-in FTP user name. This parameter is not available for HTTP requests.
 * Setting *[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.3/mod/core.html#loglevel LogLevel] debug* will print additional information in the Apache error log which can help to diagnose SQL query problems.

==Make it all working:==
Just restart apache:
{{{
apachectl stop; sleep 3; apachectl start
}}}
So, it should work now.
This module is tested to compile and work on FreeBSD 7.4.
