#summary TODO

 * Allow simultaneously using vhosts defined by original Apache's configuration file(s) and by *mod_myvhost*. (DONE)
 * Porting module to Apache 2.2.xx. (in progress)
 * Use *mod_dbd* instead of direct using MySQL. Additionally, mod_dbd give us opportunity to use many different databases, not only MySQL. (in progress)
